<p>This starter project was made by Dirk Lach.</p>
<p>To start just type <em>npm i</em> and <em>npm start</em></p>
<p>Besides a basic Eleventy configuration, you will also find a Sass watcher and a <a href="https://www.trysmudford.com/blog/encapsulated-11ty-components/">global component macro</a> (thanks to Trys Mudford)</p>
<br/>
<p>This is global component:</p>
{{ component('button') }}
<br/>
<br/>

<p>Now you can delete the content of this page, delete the button component and create your project.</p>
<p>Have fun.</p>
